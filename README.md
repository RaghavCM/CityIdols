# CityIdols
City Idols (www.cityidols.org) is an initiative to research, collate and spread information about people after whom places 
such as roads, parks and circles are named. With Mapbox, we are trying to develop an interactive map, that will allow participants to 
select a road name that they want to research. Also, in order to select a road name, participants must submit their names and Email 
addresses. In order to avoid participants selecting the same road name, only three participants must be allowed to select a 
particular road name. Further, all the researched road names, must be hyperlinked to their rspective road names on the map to open up 
content about that person's life and contributions.
